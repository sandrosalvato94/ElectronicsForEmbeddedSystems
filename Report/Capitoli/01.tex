\section{Introduction}
I'm very glad to present by this report, my own project for Electronics for Embedded Systems course. The main idea consists in  realizing a camera able to capture photos to be transferred to an host computer for further processing. Before describing in details the environmental structure, I guess it's fundamental to highlight that all the topics of the course have been covered in the following manner:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Memory}: memory controller as FSM
\item \textbf{Programmable logic device}: acts as remote to send the user command
\item \textbf{Interconnection protocol}: I2C, SCCB and UART
\item \textbf{Peripheral management}: programming of camera peripheral
\item \textbf{AD and DA converters}: usage of AD converter to sample the luminance of the environment
\item \textbf{Power management}: Step-down converter to drive a LED
\end{itemize}
Each of them owns a proper section below.
\newline
Let's have a look on the general architecture, listing the main parts of the system. The camera is connected to an ST microcontroller: a STM32F446ZET. The choice on this MCU has due to the fact that it integrates a very useful and widespread engaged peripheral in the video-capturing field: the Digital CaMera Interface (\textbf{DCMI}). All images are sent to the host computer by UART protocol, exploiting another embedded peripheral of the microcontroller. Computer reads UART's data plugging a USB-UART adapter.  Then a small Python script converts those data into a BMP image. 
\newline
The command is generated by the user pushing a specific button. An 8 buttons keyboard is tied up to the FPGA: an Altera Cyclone IV on DE0-Nano board. The implemented VHDL is composed of the keyboard driver and a fully structural UART peripheral. When a button has clicked, an encoded 8-bit data is sent to the microcontroller, which, by an interrupt, recognizes that the user pushed something. 
\newline
A breadboard has been used to build circuits for AD and Bulk converters. For sure, the following image is more clarifying for the reader.
\newline
\newline
I used STM32 CubeIDE to program the microcontroller , a software Eclipse based. To program the FPGA I exploited both Quartus II when uploading the \textit{sof} file and Xilinx ISE Design Suite when simulating (just for my high familiarity with that). Moreover, as classical laboratory instruments I relied on an oscilloscope provided by GW Instek and a multimeter for resistor measurements.

Images captured are in the format QVGA
